# dpmall
# An R package for understanding how the Dynamic Population Model produces admin-based population and migration estimates for England & Wales.

The `dpmall` package will be an interactive user guide on the methods used
in the Dynamic Population Model (DPM) that the [Office for National
Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) uses to produce admin-based population estimates (ABPEs) for 
England & Wales. It will aim to include the collection of R packages that 
have been developed to perform different parts of the estimation process that 
forms the DPM as a whole.

The documentation for `dpmall` will aim to cover all aspects of the DPM as well
as providing example data and code to explore each of the steps in more
detail.

The methods used take input data from counts of births, deaths,
migration flows and a range of population stock estimates from different
sources, by Local Authority Districts, sex, single year of age, cohort
and year and estimates a demographic account.

This `dpmall` package is in the early stages of development.
